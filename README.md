**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications. It allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into content that is served to other users. Below, you'll find:

- **Types of XSS**: Stored, Reflected, and DOM-Based.
- **Common Vulnerable Contexts**: User comments, URL parameters, etc.
- **Attack Vectors**: Examples and detailed payloads to test against.

## Types of XSS
1. **Stored XSS**: Malicious script is permanently stored on the target server.
2. **Reflected XSS**: The script is reflected off a web server, such as in an error message or a search result.
3. **DOM-Based XSS**: The vulnerability exists in the client-side code and is executed by the browser.
